# TRACED: CMOS Transient Radiation Anomaly and Cosmic-ray Event Detector
A tool for the detection of anomalous events in CMOS sensors, such as cosmic-rays or 
events associated with the natural decay of radioisotopes. 

The idea is to provide an easy-to-use interface for the detection and analysis of potential 
radiation effects on CMOS sensors, working with RAW photo files.
